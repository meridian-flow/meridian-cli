# Agent Profiles

Agent profiles are markdown files that tell Meridian how to launch and configure a specific agent: which model to use, which harness to run it on, which skills to inject, and what policies to apply when the selected model changes.

## Location

Meridian reads agent profiles from `.mars/agents/*.md`. This directory is populated by `meridian mars sync` — do not edit it directly.

```
.mars/
  agents/
    coder.md
    reviewer.md
    ...
```

To list installed profiles:

```bash
meridian mars list        # grouped by mode (primary / subagent)
meridian mars list --json # machine-readable
```

## Format

Each profile is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: reviewer
description: >
  Reviews changes for correctness, regressions, and design alignment.
model: claude-sonnet
mode: subagent
skills:
  - meridian-spawn
---

Read-only review agent. Reports findings with severity, does not edit.
```

The frontmatter controls Meridian's routing and policy behavior. The markdown body is the agent's system prompt — it replaces Claude's default system prompt when passed via `--agent`.

## Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Type | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | str | filename stem | Profile identifier used with `-a NAME` |
| `description` | str | `""` | One-line description shown in `mars list` |
| `model` | str | — | Default model alias or ID (e.g. `claude-sonnet`, `gpt-5.3-codex`) |
| `harness` | str | — | Force a specific harness (`claude`, `codex`, `opencode`) |
| `mode` | str | `subagent` | `primary` or `subagent` — controls listing grouping |
| `skills` | list[str] | `[]` | Skill names to inject into the system prompt |
| `tools` | list[str] | `[]` | Tool names to allow |
| `disallowed-tools` | list[str] | `[]` | Tool names to block |
| `mcp-tools` | list[str] | `[]` | MCP tool names to enable |
| `sandbox` | str | — | Sandbox level override |
| `effort` | str | — | Effort level (`low`, `medium`, `high`) |
| `approval` | str | — | Approval mode (`default`, `confirm`, `auto`, `yolo`) |
| `autocompact` | int | — | Compaction percentage threshold |
| `timeout` | int | — | Spawn timeout in seconds |
| `model-policies` | list | `[]` | Per-model override rules (see below) |
| `fanout` | list | `[]` | Harness-availability fallback chain (see below) |
| `models` | mapping | `{}` | Legacy per-model effort/autocompact overrides (deprecated) |

## `mode`

Controls how agents are grouped in `meridian mars list` and in the startup system prompt.

```yaml
mode: primary    # top-level orchestrators, primary sessions
mode: subagent   # spawned workers (default)
```

`meridian mars list` output:

```
AGENTS
- design-lead: Heavy design with research and adversarial review | Model: claude-opus-4-6
- product-manager: Dev workflow entry point | Model: claude-opus-4-6

## Subagent
- coder: Implementation tasks | Model: gpt55 | Fan-out: gpt55, codex
- reviewer: Adversarial review | Model: gpt-5.4 | Fan-out: gpt, opus
```

## `model-policies`

Per-model override rules applied when the resolved model matches a selector. Use this when one profile should behave differently depending on which model runs it — for example, setting higher effort for a weaker model, or forcing a specific harness for a closed-source model.

```yaml
model-policies:
  - match:
      model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
    override:
      harness: claude
      effort: high

  - match:
      alias: gpt5
    override:
      autocompact: 20

  - match:
      model-glob: "openai/*"
    override:
      sandbox: strict
```

### Match selectors

| Selector | Matches on | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | Exact canonical model ID | `model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` |
| `alias` | Exact alias token used to select the model | `alias: sonnet` |
| `model-glob` | Glob pattern against canonical model ID | `model-glob: "openai/*"` |

Matching priority: `model` (most specific) > `alias` > `model-glob` (least specific). If two rules tie at the same specificity, launch fails with an ambiguity error.

### Override keys

Scalar overrides in `override:` accept the same keys as profile-level frontmatter:

`harness`, `sandbox`, `approval`, `effort`, `autocompact`, `timeout`

### Precedence

Model-policy overrides sit between explicit user flags and the profile's generic defaults:

```
CLI flag / ENV var  >  model-policies match  >  profile defaults  >  config  >  alias defaults
```

## `fanout`

Declares a fallback model chain used when the profile's primary harness is unavailable. When Meridian detects the primary harness is not installed, it walks the fanout entries in order and selects the first one whose harness is available.

```yaml
model: claude-sonnet
fanout:
  - alias: gpt5
  - alias: codex
  - model: openai/gpt-4o
```

Each entry is either an `alias` (looked up in the model catalog) or a literal `model` ID. Fallback only activates when:

- the primary harness is unavailable, **and**
- the user did not explicitly set a model with `-m` / `MERIDIAN_MODEL`

`fanout` also controls the fan-out column shown in `meridian mars list`.

Shorthand (single alias):

```yaml
fanout: gpt5
```

## Skills and Skill Variants

When Meridian launches an agent, it loads the skills listed in `skills:` and injects them into the system prompt. Skills are read from `.mars/skills/`.

```yaml
skills:
  - meridian-spawn
  - shared-workspace
```

**Variant selection.** Skills can ship harness- or model-specific body overrides in a `variants/` subdirectory. Meridian selects the best matching variant at launch time using a 4-step specificity ladder:

1. `variants/<harness>/<model-alias>/SKILL.md` — model alias + harness
2. `variants/<harness>/<model-canonical-id>/SKILL.md` — canonical model ID + harness
3. `variants/<harness>/SKILL.md` — harness level only
4. Base `SKILL.md` — default

The base skill's frontmatter metadata is always authoritative; a variant only replaces the instruction body. Variant selection is transparent — the profile doesn't need to declare which variants a skill supports.

See [mars docs: skill-compilation.md](https://github.com/meridian-flow/mars-agents/blob/main/docs/config/skill-compilation.md) for the skill authoring format.

## Agent Listing

`meridian mars list` renders installed profiles grouped by `mode`:

```
## Primary
- my-orchestrator: Main orchestrator | Model: claude-opus-4-6

## Subagent
- coder: Implementation tasks | Model: gpt55 | Fan-out: gpt55, codex
- reviewer: Adversarial review | Model: gpt-5.4 | Fan-out: gpt, opus
```

Each line shows: name, description, default model, and fanout aliases (deduplicated by resolved model ID).

## Harness Availability Fallback

When a spawn is launched with an agent profile and the profile's primary harness is not installed, Meridian automatically tries alternatives without failing:

1. Walk `fanout` entries in declared order
2. For each entry, resolve the token to a model/harness via the alias catalog
3. Use the first entry whose harness is available
4. If no fanout entry resolves, also scan exact `model` and `alias` match values in `model-policies`
5. Skip `model-glob` rules in the fallback scan
6. If nothing resolves, fail with a clear error naming the unavailable harness

This means a profile like:

```yaml
model: claude-sonnet
fanout:
  - alias: gpt5
```

...works on a machine with only Codex installed — it silently routes to `gpt5` rather than erroring.

## Legacy `models:` Field

The `models:` mapping was an earlier mechanism for per-model `effort` and `autocompact` overrides. It is still accepted but deprecated in favor of `model-policies:`.

```yaml
# deprecated — use model-policies instead
models:
  claude-sonnet:
    effort: high
  gpt5:
    autocompact: 20
```

A deprecation warning is logged when `models:` is present without `model-policies:` or `fanout:`.

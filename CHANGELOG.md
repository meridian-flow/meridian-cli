# Changelog

Caveman style. Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versioning: [SemVer](https://semver.org/). Versions `0.0.6` through `0.0.25` in git history only — changelog fell stale, resumed at `[Unreleased]`.

## [Unreleased]
### Fixed
- OpenCode session continuation creates empty session instead of resuming. Root cause: `POST /session` ignores `sessionID` payload and always creates a new empty session. Fix: verify existing session via `GET /session/{id}` before POST; if found, return it directly. Attach then connects to the existing session with full history.

## [0.0.48] - 2026-05-03
### Added
- `meridian session export` command. Emits stitched full-session markdown transcripts; optional child spawn report appendix.
- Diagnostic guard test for launch warning suppression. Catches catalog/config warnings leaking through spawn prompt assembly.
- Telemetry v1 contract surface: 8-field envelope, event registry, process router, noop/stderr sinks, and startup sink selection.
- Telemetry v1 instrumentation: HTTP/WS lifecycle, command dispatch, dev frontend, MCP invocations, work transitions, debug tracer, stream backpressure, usage events (command invoked, model selected, spawn launched).
- `meridian telemetry tail`, `query`, `status` CLI commands. Domain/correlation filters, truncation-tolerant reader, crash-safe segment discovery.
- `--global` flag on telemetry tail/query/status. Aggregates across all project telemetry dirs plus legacy user-level segments.
- `BufferingSink` for CLI early-event capture. Buffers events before project root resolution, in-place upgrade to project-local sink.
- Per-project telemetry storage under `<project_runtime_root>/telemetry/`. Compound segment naming: `<logical_owner>.<pid>-<seq>.jsonl`.
- Spawn-store-based retention. Read-only reconciled liveness (heartbeat + runner PID + store status) replaces raw PID liveness checks.
- Legacy telemetry migration UX. Old `~/.meridian/telemetry/` segments read-only, visible via `--global`, age out via retention.
- `meridian work root` command — prints the work items container path. Escape hatch for the root that's no longer shown in agent prompts.

### Changed
- Bumped mars-agents 0.2.5→0.2.6. Skill schema: `invocation: explicit|implicit` replaced by `model-invocable` + `user-invocable` booleans. Old fields are hard errors.
- CLAUDE.md: release docs clarified — `meridian mars version` for prompt packages, `scripts/release.sh` for mars-agents and meridian-cli.
- Env vars renamed: `MERIDIAN_WORK_DIR` → `MERIDIAN_ACTIVE_WORK_DIR`, `MERIDIAN_WORK_ID` → `MERIDIAN_ACTIVE_WORK_ID`. Agents confused the context root (`$MERIDIAN_CONTEXT_WORK_DIR`) with the active item dir when both said "WORK_DIR."
- Context prompt injection no longer shows work root path. Shows `$MERIDIAN_ACTIVE_WORK_DIR` when a work item is active, explicit "(no active work item)" when none. Prevents agents from writing to the container.
- Chat backend cold spawn acquisition injects child env context (`MERIDIAN_SPAWN_ID`, `MERIDIAN_PROJECT_DIR`, `MERIDIAN_RUNTIME_DIR`, `MERIDIAN_HARNESS`). Web-launched spawns now get the same environment as CLI spawns.
- CLI telemetry sink uses inherited `MERIDIAN_SPAWN_ID` as logical owner when present. Spawn-invoked CLI commands write to the spawn's segment, not a separate `cli.*` segment.
- mars.toml targets: added `.codex` alongside `.claude` and `.opencode`.
- Primary agent profile renamed `product-manager` → `product-lead`.
- `docs/commands.md`: added telemetry CLI reference (tail, query, status, --global, filtering flags, legacy segments, rootless processes).
- Workspace help text updated for named-root merge model (`meridian.toml` + `meridian.local.toml`).

### Fixed
- Telemetry retention orphan detection checks `owner is None` (truly unrecognizable segment) instead of `not live`. Spawn-owned segments for active spawns no longer falsely deleted.
- Segment owner parsing rejects non-numeric PID/seq components via `isdigit()` guard. Prevents misidentifying filenames with hex or negative values.
- Project root resolution falls back to legacy `.agents/skills/` when `.mars/` absent. Existing projects that haven't migrated to mars still resolve correctly.

### Added
- `meridian bootstrap` primary launch command. Loads typed skill/package bootstrap docs from `.mars`, injects after skill prompts, forwards launch flags, and still runs without docs.
- Skill variant runtime selection. 4-step exact-match specificity ladder: model-token+harness > canonical-id+harness > harness > base. Base frontmatter authoritative; variants replace body only.
- Workspace system redesign. Named `[workspace.<name>]` entries in `meridian.toml` (committed, shared) and `meridian.local.toml` (gitignored, per-machine overrides) replace unnamed `[[context-roots]]` in `workspace.local.toml`. Two-tier merge by name — local overrides committed paths. `meridian workspace migrate` converts legacy config. Legacy fallback with deprecation warnings. Doctor and config-show updated for new format.
- Unified dev frontend (`meridian chat --dev`). Portless auto-detection, `--tailscale`/`--funnel` sharing, `--portless-force` route takeover. `LaunchResult` dataclass bundles session + display metadata. Policy layer resolves tailscale DNS names into `PortlessExposure.allowed_hosts`. HOST/PORT scrubbed from raw Vite child env to prevent accidental network exposure.

### Fixed
- Launch/spawn diagnostics boundary captures `meridian.lib` warnings before stderr. Agent inventory no longer needs quiet catalog scans.
- Skill prompt loading preserves base `SKILL.md` frontmatter. Variant skills now replace only body while keeping base metadata and selected variant path.
- Vite host validation in portless tailscale/funnel mode. Portless HTTPS does not bypass Vite's Host header check — tailscale hostnames were blocked with 403. Policy layer now resolves the tailscale DNS name and passes it through `VITE_DEV_ALLOWED_HOSTS`.
- Portless error classification. All immediate non-zero exits were treated as route-occupied collisions. Now captures stderr via tempfile and matches known collision indicators; generic failures surface actual stderr output.

### Changed
- Mars compiled store migrated from `.agents/` to `.mars/`. `meridian mars sync` passthrough uses managed env. Remaining `.agents` path references cleaned up in resolve.py and test fixtures.
- Mars model identity now separates harness affinity from model ID.
- OpenCode harness drops `opencode-` model prefix routing. Use `--harness opencode` to force harness selection; raw `provider/model` IDs pass through unchanged. Default OpenCode visibility narrowed to `gemini*` only.
- mars.toml targets: removed deprecated `.agents`, added `.opencode` alongside `.claude`.
- Bumped `mars-agents` 0.2.2 → 0.2.3. Agent artifacts suppressed in managed targets under `MERIDIAN_MANAGED=1`; `AgentSurfacePolicy` enum replaces bare bool.
- Makefile: portless-based `dev`/`backend`/`frontend` targets replaced with `chat`/`chat-dev`/`build-frontend`.
- Chat backend structural refactors: `server.py` now transport-only; `ChatRuntime` owns lifecycle, dispatch, close postwork, and recovery. `BackendAcquisitionFactory` + `PipelineLookup` break bootstrap cycle. Normalizers moved from `harness/normalizers/` to `chat/normalization/` (D8 superseded). TUI passthrough extracted to `harness/passthrough/` with `TuiPassthrough` protocol.
- Dead code cleanup: removed `cli/format_helpers.py` shim, dead CLI helpers, unused `ReferenceFile` aliases, `load_reference_files()`, speculative `CreateChatRequest` model/harness fields, stale re-exports, unused function params, unreachable recovery logic.
- Chat backend test suite expanded from 1289 to 1329 tests. New coverage: recovery edge cases (truncated JSONL, corrupt index, idempotency), concurrency races (parallel create, dispatch fencing, close+prompt), WebSocket fanout (reconnection, multi-client, ack framing), HITL flow (approve, answer_input, stale generation), CLI passthrough registry.

### Fixed
- `MERIDIAN_HARNESS` env var no longer overrides child spawn profile harness selection. Child spawns respect their own profile's harness preference.
- Model policy override application and launch policy selection gates fixed for edge cases.
- `spawn wait` yield interval now reads parent harness (`MERIDIAN_HARNESS` env) instead of scanning child spawn rows. Keeps the *caller's* prompt cache alive, not the children's.
- Claude default `wait_yield_seconds` bumped from 270s to 900s — matches Codex, well within Claude Code Max 1-hour cache TTL.
- Workspace projection now includes meridian context paths (work, kb, archive, extras) in harness sandbox permissions. OpenCode/Claude/Codex spawns can access work item artifacts and knowledge base.
- `meridian work` / `meridian work list` no longer crash when a work item exists in both active and archive directories. Warns instead of failing, dashboard stays usable.
- Chat recovery no longer emits duplicate `runtime.error` on repeated restarts of the same abandoned chat. SQLite index now consistent with JSONL after recovery.

### Added
- Model-policy system for agent profiles. Agent profiles now declare `model-policies` with mode parsing, structured fanout display, and per-mode harness preferences. `meridian mars models list` groups by mode. Runtime model-policy matching selects models by harness availability. `ModelSelectionContext` threads through spawn preparation for resolve-once identity. Dry-run surfaces routing provenance. Unrouteable fanout fallback models skipped instead of erroring.
- Agent-aware CLI help. `meridian spawn --agent <name> --help` shows profile-specific help supplements alongside generic spawn help.
- Portless dev workflow. `meridian chat --dev` discovers frontend via `MERIDIAN_DEV_FRONTEND_ROOT` and serves it without requiring a separate port. `PORT` env var support for backend.
- `meridian-web` dev workflow and shared workspace config scaffolding.
- `meridian chat` management commands: `ls`, `show`, `log`, `close`; server discovery file; REST `GET /chat` and `GET /chat/{id}/events`.
- `meridian chat --headless/--no-headless`; non-headless says frontend absent, keeps API-only mode.
- `meridian chat` starts the local headless chat backend with host/port/model/harness options.
- Codex/OpenCode chat normalizers plus cross-harness parity tests for turn/content/file events.
- Chat backend SQLite projection, HITL REST responses, and git checkpoint create/revert.
- Chat backend FastAPI transport: REST command wrappers, bidirectional WebSocket command acks, fan-out, replay, close replay, and restart lost-backend recovery.
- Claude chat backend vertical slice: harness normalizer registry, Claude event normalization, and cold SpawnManager acquisition with observer-before-start.
- Chat substrate: normalized ChatEvent, shared ChatCommand dispatch, JSONL event log, lifecycle service, backend handle, observer bridge, and persistence-first pipeline.

- Harness connection runtime HITL seam. Codex server requests now pass through typed handler policy before JSON-RPC responses; default auto-accept keeps existing spawn behavior.
- `meridian mermaid check` style warnings: ox-edge, bare-end, fill-no-color
- `--strict` flag: treat warnings as errors
- `--no-style` flag: disable style checks
- `--disable` flag: suppress specific warning categories
- Inline suppression via `%% mermaid-check-ignore` comments
- JSON output includes warnings array and counts
- Failed spawn sentinel. Terminal `failed` transition writes `failure.json`; app service can read it back.
- Lifecycle telemetry event model, observer protocol, event names, and per-spawn sequence counter skeleton for future spawn observer hooks.
- `scripts/quality-issues.sh` helper. Lists open quality/immediate GitHub issues, skips `future`, groups by priority: high, medium, low, unprioritized.
- Arbitrary named contexts. Define `[context.<name>]` in `meridian.toml` for custom context roots. `meridian context <name>` resolves and displays. `ContextEntryOutput` model exposes source, path, resolved fields.
- Frontend chat: multi-column spawn view, chat composer with submit/clear, thread activity tracking, session list sidebar, spawn header with streaming controls, ChatContext LRU eviction, conversation effects refactor.

### Removed
- `MERIDIAN_HARNESS_COMMAND` env var. Harness adapters are the only launch path.
- `backlog/` directory deleted — tracking moved to GitHub Issues.
- Windows CI matrix. Ubuntu-only until Windows support is re-validated.
- Archived old frontend, FastAPI app server, HCP chat stack, `meridian app` command, app-backed tests, and built UI artifacts. Active codebase clear for fresh `meridian chat` / `meridian app` rebuild.

### Changed
- `meridian spawn wait` yield default now harness-aware: unknown 240s, Claude 270s, Codex 900s; mixed waits use shortest. `--yield-after-secs` still overrides.
- Harness event semantics now live in narrow pure helpers for terminal outcome, activity transitions, and signal clearing.
- `meridian kg check` now reports broken links, `[!FLAG]` blocks, and git conflict markers. Broken links and flags are warnings (exit 0); conflict markers are errors (exit 1). `--strict` makes warnings exit-affecting. JSON includes all categories/counts. No early exit.
- `git-autosync` rebase conflicts stay in clone for review by default; `conflict_policy = "abort"` restores old abort behavior. Future runs detect existing rebase state, skip all operations.
- App-server-backed extension invocation now reports no app server while local extension discovery/dispatch stays active.
- `POST /api/spawns` resolve-before-persist. No spawn row created on composition failure. Row metadata (model, agent, harness) reflects resolved values — no "unknown" placeholders.
- `POST /api/spawns/{id}/archive` routed through `SpawnApplicationService`. Terminal-only gate: 409 if spawn not yet terminal. Idempotent: returns `{noop: true}` if already archived.
- Spawn cancel now uses one application service for CLI and HTTP; managed primary cancel behavior shared across both surfaces.
- Codex startup telemetry now emits canonical typed phases via lifecycle observers, not string callback messages.
- `scripts/release.sh` now keeps pytest output visible during pre-release checks, so long full-suite runs no longer look hung.
- Pyright warning cleanup across CLI, state, app, and launch code. Type-check baseline now clean: `0 errors, 0 warnings`.
- Launch policy model resolve now one-pass carry-through. Reuse one resolved alias entry for harness pick, final model, same-layer compatibility check, and model defaults.
- Launch effort/autocompact precedence now one named ladder helper: explicit user -> profile `models:` -> profile defaults -> alias defaults -> none. `launch.resolve` compatibility shim for `resolve_policies` removed; unmatched profile `models:` fallback now debug-only log.
- Prompt package deps unpinned in `mars.toml`; `meridian-dev-workflow` lock now v0.1.8.
- SpawnManager now supports post-persist event observers. Slow/failing observers isolated from drain loop and subscriber fan-out; legacy `on_event` stays as shim.

### Fixed
- Chat final-gate leaks/races: `meridian chat --harness` now honors global parse, checkpoints serialize git mutations per server, and failed chat heartbeat startup stops spawned backend.
- Chat backend final-gate blockers: per-turn generation fencing, checkpoint multi-chat guard, failed acquisition observer rollback, and harness selection regression coverage.
- Codex confirm-mode approval requests rejected again in websocket adapter. Slow observer shutdown now times out, so spawn teardown no hang forever.
- `kg check` skips `[!FLAG]` blocks and git conflict markers inside fenced code blocks.
- Mermaid style checks skip YAML frontmatter and directive bodies; `fill-no-color` no longer treats `stroke-color:` as text color.
- `meridian doctor` active-spawn warning now post-reconcile. Warning only lists genuinely live sessions, not stale rows just repaired. Same-run `--prune` can now clean artifacts that became eligible after reconciliation. Cached summary no longer suggests `--prune --global` when only live sessions remain.
- Failure sentinels now write after terminal state persists. Stale `failure.json` ignored unless spawn still `failed`.
- Startup telemetry now carries harness/model/agent context and Codex emits phases outside observer mode too.
- Context query error message now lists all available context names including extra contexts.
- Spawn model aliases keep alias defaults through prepare. `spawn -m gpt55` now matches primary `--model gpt55` effort.

## [0.0.45] - 2026-04-25

### Changed
- `meridian kg check` now reports broken links, `[!FLAG]` blocks, and git conflict markers. Broken links and flags are warnings (exit 0); conflict markers are errors (exit 1). `--strict` makes warnings exit-affecting. JSON includes all categories/counts. No early exit.
- `git-autosync` rebase conflicts stay in clone for review by default; `conflict_policy = "abort"` restores old abort behavior. Future runs detect existing rebase state, skip all operations.
- `mars-agents` 0.1.18 -> 0.1.19. Mars model listing now uses harness-aware runnable visibility and OpenCode provider/model availability.
- Background spawn note trimmed. `meridian spawn --bg` now returns a short "Backgrounded. Spawn id: ... Collect later with \`meridian spawn wait\`." hint instead of a long immediate-wait warning.
- `meridian models list` now fails fast. Use `meridian mars models list`.
- Codex managed primary stabilized. `meridian codex` fresh, resume, and fork sessions all use managed `app-server` path — no silent black-box fallback. Fresh sessions gate TUI attach on rollout materialization (`session_meta` present, not full turn completion). Startup telemetry phases shown on stderr: `Starting Codex app-server...` → `Connecting managed observer...` → `Creating fresh Codex thread...` → `Materializing rollout...` → `Attaching Codex TUI...`. Managed startup failure is loud — not silent. See [codex-tui-passthrough.md](docs/codex-tui-passthrough.md).
- App server TCP launch now auto-increments default port when `7676` busy.

### Added
- `state.retention_days` config key. TTL for stale state pruning: `-1` never prune, `0` prune immediately, positive = days. Default 30. Env var `MERIDIAN_STATE_RETENTION_DAYS`.
- `meridian doctor --prune` deletes stale spawn artifacts for the current project. `--prune --global` also prunes orphan project dirs machine-wide under `~/.meridian/projects/`.
- Background doctor cache. `meridian` / `meridian app` launch kicks scan after 24h; next text command shows one-line cleanup hint.
- Session-scoped `MERIDIAN_HOME` test isolation. Tests no longer leak project dirs into user state.
- AG-UI replay cursor pagination core. Raw seq cursor, lazy history iterator, invalid cursor errors.
- WebSocket replay attach flow. Client sends `replay_ack` cursor; live stream skips already replayed events and keeps terminal sentinel.
- `meridian spawn cancel-all`. Cancels all running spawns, optionally scoped to work item.
- HCP core skeleton: capabilities, errors, lifecycle types, session manager. App lifespan restores HCP chats.
- HCP harness adapters for Claude, Codex, OpenCode. HCP chats persist native session IDs from connection or stream events.

### Fixed
- Fresh managed `meridian codex` attach now waits for rollout `session_meta`, not full bootstrap turn completion.
- Claude AG-UI assistant snapshots now emit thinking, tool calls, and exact text newlines.
- AG-UI replay lazy history scan no longer loads full `history.jsonl`.
- Model alias resolution no longer fails dry-run/policy paths when mars reports the target harness binary is unavailable on the host. Explicit mars harness route still used.
- HCP chat launch failure now finalizes spawn and stops session. Active HCP chats get heartbeat. Restore skips stopped chats.
- HCP adapters no longer start harness connections; SpawnManager owns lifecycle.
- Codex launch spec now carries base, developer, user-turn instruction channels for managed websocket plumbing.
- Codex subprocess projection inline again, so spawn inventory/report text reaches child prompt.
- OpenCode streaming now sends system instructions via message `system`, user/context via `parts`.
- OpenCode HTTP connection: removed dead API path probing (`/sessions`, `/api/health`, cancel/stop variants), HTML workaround code, and speculative payload variants. Paths now match known opencode API surface.
- OpenCode TUI projection no longer emits `--variant` (only valid for `opencode run`, not the bare TUI command). Was causing `meridian opencode` to exit immediately with help text.
- OpenCode workspace projection now emits `external_directory` as `{path: "allow"}` object instead of array. Matches opencode's Effect/Zod permission schema.
- OpenCode and Codex primary launches always use managed backend (`serve` → HTTP API → `attach`). Previously gated to resume-only, which forced fresh launches through black-box TUI path — losing system prompt delivery and session tracking.
- OpenCode TUI projection no longer emits `--prompt` for interactive launches. System prompt is delivered via managed backend's message system field; user types the first message.
- OpenCode system prompt now materialised as temp file in `/tmp` and injected via `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` `instructions` config. Path is opaque to the model (OpenCode prefixes instructions with `Instructions from: <path>`). Merges with existing `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` entries.
- OpenCode spawn message delivery now uses `prompt_async` endpoint (fire-and-forget, 204). Old `/message` endpoint streamed the LLM response in the body — early `response.release()` was cancelling prompt execution server-side, so spawns never got assistant responses. Falls back to `/message` for older OpenCode versions.
- OpenCode adapter no longer sets `agent_name` on launch spec. OpenCode doesn't support native meridian agents; agent body goes via system prompt composition.
- OpenCode adapter no longer sets `OPENCODE_WORKSPACE_ID=meridian` env override. Was causing "Workspace Unavailable" popup in TUI.
- Spawn finalization now treats `history.jsonl` as output before legacy `output.jsonl`.
- Windows CI path assertions now use Meridian's slash-normalized prompt and hook payload paths.
- Concurrent `work ensure` metadata initialization now serializes status-file creation before atomic replace.
- App locator prune test no longer expects POSIX UDS cleanup on Windows.
- Hook timeout cleanup terminates the whole subprocess tree before draining pipes. Windows shell wrappers no longer leave child hooks holding stdout open.
- Plugin API file-lock contract test reads the PID after releasing the lock, matching Windows exclusive-lock semantics.
- Smoke tests run CLI subprocesses against the repo project explicitly. Windows no longer burns time resolving `uv run meridian` from each temp repo.

## [0.0.44] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- `meridian models list --all` — delegates to mars, shows all alias-filter candidates.
- `meridian test chat` — single-spawn browser chat.
- `meridian kg` — knowledge graph analysis CLI. `kg` bare shows stats + hints. `kg graph` shows link topology tree with box-drawing connectors, `--depth N` (default 3), `--external`, `--exclude`, `--format json`. `kg check` broken-link CI gate (exit 0/1). `.kgignore` for persistent exclusions via `pathspec`. Renamed from `lib/kb` → `lib/kg`.
- `meridian mermaid check` — mermaid diagram validation. Python heuristic parser (default), optional JS strict parser with Node.js. Scans `.md`, `.mmd`, `.mermaid` files. `--depth`, `--exclude`, `--format json`, `.mermaidignore`. Catches unknown diagram types, unclosed directives, mismatched blocks.
- `lib/ignores.py` — shared gitignore-style pattern loader (used by kg and mermaid).
- `pathspec` dependency for gitignore-style ignore file matching.
- Per-spawn details endpoint, infinite scroll.

### Changed
- `meridian kg check` now reports broken links, `[!FLAG]` blocks, and git conflict markers. Broken links and flags are warnings (exit 0); conflict markers are errors (exit 1). `--strict` makes warnings exit-affecting. JSON includes all categories/counts. No early exit.
- `git-autosync` rebase conflicts stay in clone for review by default; `conflict_policy = "abort"` restores old abort behavior. Future runs detect existing rebase state, skip all operations.
- `mars-agents` 0.1.17 → 0.1.18. Mars alias defaults (`default_effort`, `autocompact`) now flow into Meridian model resolution.
- Manual e2e guides for repeatable CLI checks migrated to automated `tests/smoke/` tests. `tests/e2e/README.md` now lists only remaining manual harness/network guides.
- `mars-agents` 0.1.16 → 0.1.17. Three-step resolve, three-tier list, user wildcards.
- `lib/kb` → `lib/kg`. Coverage/symbol analysis removed.
- `BroadcastHub[T]` extracted from duplicated broadcasters.
- Runner split into phase helpers (#97). Reaper split via strategy (#96). Observer into connection contract. `primary_meta.py` + `managed_primary.py` extracted.

### Fixed
- `resolve_model` passes mars-resolved `model_id` to harness (`opus-4-6` → `claude-opus-4-6`).
- Watchdog flag reconcile on early completion.
- Observer mode stale flag on restart.
- Spawn fallback respects finalizing for `live_first`.
- Drain loop grace period before force-cancel.
- Leaked subprocess on launcher death.
- OpenCode `turn_active` mapping.
- Finalizing prefers transcript over stale live output.
- Session seed double-seeding.
- Hide attempt exit fields on active spawns.

### Added
- **Extension system**: `meridian ext list|show|commands|run` CLI commands and `extension_list_commands`/`extension_invoke` MCP tools. Offline discovery works without app server; app-bound invocation uses locator + token auth. Exit codes: 2=no server, 3=stale, 7=invalid args.
- **Extension registry CLI generation**: All CLI command modules switched from `registration.py` to registry-based `ext_registration.py`. Handler keys now fully qualified (e.g. `meridian.work.start`). Old `registration.py` deleted.
- **`ExtensionCommandSpec` augmentation**: `cli_group`, `cli_name`, `agent_default_format`, `sync_handler` fields. `from_op()` factory wraps op-style handlers. Registry gains `get_by_cli()` and `list_for_cli_group()`.
- **Remote extension invoker**: Shared `RemoteExtensionInvoker` with sync/async methods for CLI and MCP dispatch.
- **`lib/markdown`** — thin wrapper around `markdown-it-py` for heading, fenced block, link, image, and wikilink extraction.
- **`lib/kg`** — knowledge graph analysis: broken link detection, orphan identification, missing backlinks, connected clusters. `meridian kg graph` and `meridian kg check` commands; `/api/kg/*` HTTP routes.
- **`lib/mermaid`** — Python wrapper for mermaid diagram validation via bundled JS parser. Node.js preflight, per-block validation with timeout.
- **`lib/core/depth.py`** — extracted depth helpers from inline usage across CLI, doctor, reaper, and work lifecycle.
- `lib/core/formatting.py` — shared text formatting (`tabular`, `kv_block`) extracted from CLI layer so ops/catalog models no longer import `cli.format_helpers` (#85).
- `ResolvedContext.from_environment()` accepts explicit `explicit_project_root` / `explicit_runtime_root` kwargs — context resolution no longer mutates `os.environ` (#81).
- `plugin_api` contract tests pin the narrowed public surface and verify unstable helpers stay in submodules.
- **Managed primary attach**: `PrimaryAttachLauncher` orchestrates backend + TUI lifecycle for Codex/OpenCode. Activity tracking via `primary_meta.json` sidecar. TOCTOU port retry (3 attempts). Black-box fallback on managed startup failure. Codex/OpenCode non-fork → managed path; Claude and fork → black-box.
- **Primary observer mode**: Codex and OpenCode connections support observer mode — skip initial turn/message, Codex declines server RPCs with -32601 so TUI handles approvals.
- **Primary transcript resolution hardening**: Primary sessions resolve via native harness transcripts only. Lazy session ID detection with persistence. Harness adapters respect `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`.
- App server: multi-viewer WebSocket with `EventBroadcaster` fan-out, 30s keepalive ping, 90s stale timeout.
- Extension manifest hash now includes `args_schema` and `result_schema` — schema-only changes rotate the hash.
- Extension invocation observability: app server dispatcher writes to `extension-invocations.jsonl`.
- Extension invoke accepts `work_id` and `spawn_id` selector fields through CLI/MCP/HTTP.
- Constant-time token comparison via `secrets.compare_digest` in app server auth.
- Local `meridian ext run` dispatches in-process for extensions that don't require app server.
- **Frontend AppShell**: Extension-driven shell with ActivityBar, TopBar, StatusBar, ModeViewport. Modes register via `ExtensionRegistry` singleton without shell hardcoding.
- **Frontend Sessions mode**: Live spawn list with FilterBar, grouped by work item, SSE-backed refetch, context menu actions (cancel/fork/archive). StatusBar shows live spawn counts.
- **Frontend Chat mode**: Multi-column spawn view (up to 4 side-by-side). ChatContext with LRU eviction, SessionList sidebar, SpawnHeader with streaming controls, ThreadColumn with composer.
- **Frontend ⌘K command palette**: Fuzzy search over registered commands via `cmdk`. Mode switching, new session, theme toggle. Global `⌘K`/`Ctrl+K` shortcut.
- **Frontend NewSessionDialog**: Submits to `POST /api/spawns` with agent/model/prompt selection.

### Changed
- `meridian kg check` now reports broken links, `[!FLAG]` blocks, and git conflict markers. Broken links and flags are warnings (exit 0); conflict markers are errors (exit 1). `--strict` makes warnings exit-affecting. JSON includes all categories/counts. No early exit.
- `git-autosync` rebase conflicts stay in clone for review by default; `conflict_policy = "abort"` restores old abort behavior. Future runs detect existing rebase state, skip all operations.
- Agent-mode CLI output defaults to text for all commands. Prior JSON defaults on `config.get`, `spawn.cancel`, `spawn.create`, `spawn.continue`, `spawn.wait`, `context`, `work.current` flipped to text. Explicit `--json` still available.
- `spawn.wait` omits report body by default; pass `--report` to include. Report path always shown.
- Lifecycle events (`meridian.spawn.start`, `meridian.spawn.done`) suppressed in agent mode for all commands. Human mode routes `TextSink.event()` to stderr.
- `SpawnWaitMultiOutput` and `SpawnDetailOutput` now have sparse `to_cli_wire()` projections for explicit JSON; omit internal fields like `harness_session_id`, `log_path`, `process_exit_code`.
- Background spawn output now explicitly instructs agents to wait: "You MUST run..." with machine-actionable fields `terminal`, `wait_required`, `wait_command` in JSON output.
- `MERIDIAN_DEPTH` parsing and nested-execution checks now share one core helper. CLI agent mode, doctor, reaper, work warnings, subrun events, and max-depth gates use same zero-based contract.
- Docs and KB now spell out zero-based depth, immediate parent spawn linkage, and fail-closed root-only repair gates.
- `plugin_api` public surface narrowed to hook types + state helpers only. Unstable utilities (`file_lock`, `generate_repo_slug`, `normalize_repo_url`, `resolve_clone_path`, `get_git_overrides`, `get_user_config`) moved to submodule imports (#94).
- 7 ops/catalog modules now import formatting from `lib/core/formatting` instead of `cli.format_helpers`. CLI shim re-exports for backwards compat (#85).
- User docs audited: `mcp-tools.md` rewritten (was listing 16 deleted tools), `commands.md` fixed wrong command names, `configuration.md` fixed stale `models.toml` section, `troubleshooting.md` fixed artifact paths.
- Codex WebSocket message size limit split from shared harness constant to per-adapter value.
- `OperationSpec` collapsed into `ExtensionCommandSpec` via `from_op()`. `OperationSpec` class, `OperationSurface`, and related APIs deleted from `manifest.py`.
- `ExtensionSurface.ALL` removed — surface sets now explicit per command (`{CLI, MCP, HTTP}`).
- App server health endpoint no longer requires auth — explicitly public.
- `archive_spawn` and related helpers promoted from private `_archive_spawn` to public API.

### Removed
- `registration.py` — CLI command registration replaced by extension registry.
- Old MCP `OperationSpec` → MCP tool projection in server. Extension system's `extension_list_commands`/`extension_invoke` replaces it.
- `ops_bridge.py` intermediate layer — collapsed into direct `from_op()` calls.

### Fixed
- `spawn show` no longer prints `Exited at` / `Process exit code` for active retrying spawns. Attempt-exit fields stay visible only after terminal status, so active retries no longer look stuck-finalized.
- Primary launch preserves `MERIDIAN_DEPTH`; root sessions stay depth `0` while delegated spawns still increment.
- Malformed non-empty `MERIDIAN_DEPTH` no longer enables root-only repair/reaper side effects.
- App server startup no longer crashes on Windows — `os.fchmod` guard behind `IS_WINDOWS` (#87).
- `_read_mars_merged_file` no longer falls back to `Path.cwd()` when `project_root` is None; returns empty dict instead of silently loading wrong project's aliases (#91).
- Context resolution (`ops/context.py`) no longer temporarily mutates `os.environ`; uses explicit kwargs instead (#81).

## [0.0.43] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- Nested Claude managed spawns now deny native delegation tools (Agent, TaskCreate, TaskGet, TaskList, TaskOutput, TaskStop, TaskUpdate) by default. Profiles opt out per-tool via `tools:` frontmatter listing. Prevents untracked sub-agent spawns outside Meridian policy.

### Changed
- `meridian kg check` now reports broken links, `[!FLAG]` blocks, and git conflict markers. Broken links and flags are warnings (exit 0); conflict markers are errors (exit 1). `--strict` makes warnings exit-affecting. JSON includes all categories/counts. No early exit.
- `git-autosync` rebase conflicts stay in clone for review by default; `conflict_policy = "abort"` restores old abort behavior. Future runs detect existing rebase state, skip all operations.
- `resolve_child_execution_cwd()` always returns `project_root`. Prior CLAUDECODE→spawn_log_dir redirect removed; `.claude/settings.json` now discovered correctly in nested Claude contexts.

### Fixed
- Nested spawns keep `MERIDIAN_PROJECT_DIR` on project root when harness cwd moves to spawn artifact dir. Agent profile lookup no longer searches `.agents/` under artifact dirs.

## [0.0.42] - 2026-04-22

### Changed
- `meridian kg check` now reports broken links, `[!FLAG]` blocks, and git conflict markers. Broken links and flags are warnings (exit 0); conflict markers are errors (exit 1). `--strict` makes warnings exit-affecting. JSON includes all categories/counts. No early exit.
- `git-autosync` rebase conflicts stay in clone for review by default; `conflict_policy = "abort"` restores old abort behavior. Future runs detect existing rebase state, skip all operations.
- Spawn prompt projection now has one shared inline path. Codex and OpenCode inherit base inline projection: system instructions, task context, then user task.
- Harness adapter docs now name the canonical prompt category routing and inline block order.

### Removed
- Dead `PromptPolicy` / `filter_launch_content` prompt-composition API.
- OpenCode `--file` reference projection. References now inline or omit empty files until real native delivery exists.

### Fixed
- Spawn prompt composition now always includes loaded skills and agent inventory before harness projection, so Claude/Codex/OpenCode receive the same semantic payload through their supported channels.
- OpenCode streaming no longer drops `-f` reference content by advertising native file injection it cannot deliver.

## [0.0.41] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- Claude spawn-prepare now projects loaded skills, agent inventory, and report instructions into `system-prompt`/`append-system-prompt` for fresh and continued sessions; system prompt no longer report-only.

## [0.0.40] - 2026-04-22

### Changed
- `meridian kg check` now reports broken links, `[!FLAG]` blocks, and git conflict markers. Broken links and flags are warnings (exit 0); conflict markers are errors (exit 1). `--strict` makes warnings exit-affecting. JSON includes all categories/counts. No early exit.
- `git-autosync` rebase conflicts stay in clone for review by default; `conflict_policy = "abort"` restores old abort behavior. Future runs detect existing rebase state, skip all operations.
- App chat UI migrated from frontend-v2.
- Thread activity internals now named around spawn activity and stream control.
- Agent mode output defaults now per command: control-plane -> JSON, read/browse -> text.
- JSON mode no hidden JSONL `AgentSink` envelope; command JSON writes direct.

### Fixed
- Git-backed context roots now project to harness launches as `--add-dir`, so Claude/Codex can read work/kb files under context clones without extra prompts.
- App streaming clears when harness emits `STEP_FINISHED`.
- Cancelled AG-UI events now emit `RUN_ERROR` with `isCancelled`.

## [0.0.40-rc.2] - 2026-04-22

### Changed
- `meridian kg check` now reports broken links, `[!FLAG]` blocks, and git conflict markers. Broken links and flags are warnings (exit 0); conflict markers are errors (exit 1). `--strict` makes warnings exit-affecting. JSON includes all categories/counts. No early exit.
- `git-autosync` rebase conflicts stay in clone for review by default; `conflict_policy = "abort"` restores old abort behavior. Future runs detect existing rebase state, skip all operations.
- Default app server port changed from `8420` to `7676`. Vite proxy config updated to match.
- **Work items: directory is the work item.** Eliminated `work-items/` metadata index. Work item exists iff its directory exists in `work/` (active) or `archive/work/` (done). `__status.json` inside each dir holds mutable metadata. `meridian work list` scans the actual work directory — no separate index to drift. Auto-heals missing/malformed status files. Fixes #69, #70.
- `work list --done` now paginated: shows last 10 by default, `-n N` for custom limit, `--all` for everything.
- Archive/reopen crash-safe: archive moves dir first then writes metadata; reopen clears metadata first then moves. Crash leaves recoverable state.
- No lock files for work operations — all ops are single atomic steps or idempotent. Eliminates `fcntl.flock` from work path (Windows first-class).
- `.meridian/id` now committed to git — stable project identity across clones/worktrees. `ensure_gitignore()` migrates old `.gitignore` files automatically (strips `id` ignore, adds `!id` to required lines).
- **Naming overhaul**: no "repo" or "state root" anywhere. `repo_root` → `project_root`, `state_root` → `runtime_root`, `MERIDIAN_REPO_ROOT` → `MERIDIAN_PROJECT_DIR`, `MERIDIAN_STATE_ROOT` → `MERIDIAN_RUNTIME_DIR`, `get_user_state_root` → `get_meridian_home`, `get_project_state_root` → `get_project_data_root`, `StatePaths` → `ProjectPaths`, `StateRootPaths` → `RuntimePaths`, `RepoStatePaths` → `ProjectPaths`, `.state_root` field → `.runtime_root`. Breaking rename — no backwards compat aliases.

### Fixed
- Background spawns use `--project-root` for worker launch. No stale `--repo-root` crash after rename.
- `MERIDIAN_SPAWN_ID` now set to current spawn's own ID; `MERIDIAN_PARENT_SPAWN_ID` set to parent. Previously both were swapped.
- `spawn children` agent-mode output uses children view instead of raw spawn list.
- Integration tests no longer crash on structlog writes to stale capsys buffers (reset moved to integration conftest).

### Removed
- `work-items/` directory, `work-items.flock`, `work-items.rename.intent.json` — all replaced by directory-as-work-item model.
- `RuntimePaths.work_items_dir`, `work_items_flock`, `work_items_rename_intent` fields.
- `WorkRenameIntent` model, `reconcile_work_store()` function, all `lock_file()` calls in work_store.

## [0.0.40-rc.1] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- Launch artifacts now emit `references.json` when references exist, with per-item routing (`inline`, `native-injection`, `omitted`) and native flag detail.

### Changed
- `meridian kg check` now reports broken links, `[!FLAG]` blocks, and git conflict markers. Broken links and flags are warnings (exit 0); conflict markers are errors (exit 1). `--strict` makes warnings exit-affecting. JSON includes all categories/counts. No early exit.
- `git-autosync` rebase conflicts stay in clone for review by default; `conflict_policy = "abort"` restores old abort behavior. Future runs detect existing rebase state, skip all operations.
- Claude primary launch now separates system instructions from the starting user prompt instead of appending the full prompt to system.
- Launch artifacts now write from one shared projection path. Primary uses adapter `ProjectedContent` as authority for `system-prompt.md`, `starting-prompt.md`, and `projection-manifest.json`.
- Spawn prepare now excludes OpenCode native-injected files from inline prompt content, so `--file` delivery is single path, not duplicated inline+native.
- `session log` now reads active spawn `output.jsonl` when harness transcript missing, with source shown in output.

### Removed
- Spawn execute path no longer writes legacy `prompt.md` or `delivery-manifest.json` artifacts.
- `spawn log` command removed. Use `session log <spawn_id>`.

### Fixed
- Projection manifest routing for Codex/OpenCode primary launches now reflects adapter-declared inline channels instead of Claude-only defaults.
- Direct spawn execution now reloads `reference_files` into launch context so OpenCode native `--file` routing and `references.json` are computed from authoritative reference items.

## [0.0.39] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **`-f` directory support**: `-f dir/` renders depth-3 tree in prompt (blocked dirs annotated, deterministic sort, cross-platform). Files always inline regardless of harness. Orchestrators pass context packages without enumerating every file.
- **Hook system**: Event-driven hooks for lifecycle events (`spawn.created`, `spawn.running`, `spawn.finalized`, `work.started`, `work.done`). External hooks (subprocess) and built-in hooks (Python). CLI: `hooks list`, `hooks check`, `hooks run`.
- **git-autosync**: Built-in hook for syncing git-backed contexts. Auto-registers when `source = "git"`. Interval throttling, fail-open semantics.
- **App server Phase 1-3**: Sessions/SSE/Work facade endpoints, Files mode, spawn archive, catalog endpoints, and thread inspector endpoints.
- **`meridian.local.toml`**: Personal config overrides, gitignored. Precedence: local > project > user.
- **Context backend**: Git-backed contexts via `[context.work]` and `[context.kb]` with `source = "git"` and `remote = "..."`. Paths resolve to `~/.meridian/git/<slug>/`. Lazy clone — bootstrap skips git-backed dirs, git-autosync handles cloning.
- **Plugin API v1**: Stable contract at `meridian.plugin_api` for hooks/plugins. Exports: hook types, state helpers, git helpers, config helpers, file locking.

### Changed
- `meridian kg check` now reports broken links, `[!FLAG]` blocks, and git conflict markers. Broken links and flags are warnings (exit 0); conflict markers are errors (exit 1). `--strict` makes warnings exit-affecting. JSON includes all categories/counts. No early exit.
- `git-autosync` rebase conflicts stay in clone for review by default; `conflict_policy = "abort"` restores old abort behavior. Future runs detect existing rebase state, skip all operations.
- CLI help text updated: root epilogue and `spawn` description now advertise primary launch/resume/fork forms, session ref syntax (`c123`/`p123`/raw), foreground capture fallback (Unix TTY, falls back to subprocess on Windows/non-TTY), and correct `--autocompact` range (1-100). Agent root help updated to match.
- `spawn show/children/files/cancel/wait/log` accept chat_id refs (e.g. `c213`). Resolves to most recent spawn with that chat_id.
- `meridian context` command — returns context tuple (`work_id`, `repo_root`, `state_root`, `depth`). JSON when spawned or with `--json`; human-friendly text in TTY.
- Git clone slug shortened: `meridian-flow-docs` instead of `github.com-meridian-flow-docs`. Collision detection still works (errors if existing clone has different remote).
- Context resolver is now pure — no clone side effects. Bootstrap skips mkdir for git-backed paths.

### Fixed
- `spawn --from c123` now uses the chat's primary spawn and transcript pointer. No more latest-child report bleed. `spawn --from p123` keeps concrete spawn report/files context.
- Top-level unreadable `-f` directory now raises `PermissionError` instead of silent empty tree.
- Windows: `_fsync_directory` no-op on Windows (not supported).
- Windows: `output.jsonl` capture enabled on Windows.
- Windows: Guardrails platform dispatch for `.cmd`/`.ps1` scripts.
- Windows: `Path.home()` → `get_home_path()` to respect `HOME` env var.
- Windows: fcntl test skip on Windows.
- Windows: Path assertion normalized for cross-platform.
- git-autosync event name: `work.start` → `work.started` to match actual lifecycle dispatch.
- `source = "git"` without `remote`: warns and falls back to local instead of broken state.
- App server path security hardened: resolved-root validation, traversal guards, Unicode path coverage, and delete/rename boundary checks.
- Primary launch prompt materialization fixed for process projection path.
- Spec-driven launch argv projection now handles typed harness fields.
- Native reference delivery now carries `reference_items` through launch specs.

## [0.0.33] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- `meridian opencode` primary launch passed the startup prompt as the root positional `project` arg instead of OpenCode's `--prompt` flag. OpenCode tried to `open()` the whole session prompt as a path and quit immediately with `ENAMETOOLONG`.

## [0.0.32] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- Primary launch (`meridian` with no subcommand) dropped into JSON streaming mode instead of interactive TUI. Regression from 0.0.31 launch refactoring — `interactive` flag wasn't propagated to run inputs for PRIMARY composition surface.
- Primary launch viewport sizing: PTY now created with correct terminal dimensions before child process starts. Was using `pty.fork()` which sets size after child starts; now uses `pty.openpty()` + manual fork so child sees correct size from first query.

## [0.0.31] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- `workspace.local.toml` support for multi-repo context injection. Declare `[[context-roots]]` entries pointing at sibling repos; meridian projects them to harness launches. Local-only file, gitignored by default.
- `workspace init` command creates template file with commented examples, adds local gitignore coverage via `.git/info/exclude`.
- `config show` workspace surface: status, root counts, per-harness applicability. JSON: `workspace = {status, path?, roots:{count,enabled,missing}, applicability:{claude,codex,opencode}}`.
- `doctor` workspace findings: `workspace_invalid`, `workspace_unknown_key`, `workspace_missing_root`, `workspace_unsupported_harness`.
- Launch projection: Claude (`--add-dir`), OpenCode (`permission.external_directory` env). Codex deferred to `harness-permission-abstraction` (requires CODEX_HOME config generation).
- Invalid workspace pre-launch gate blocks spawn before harness contact.
- Shared `ConfigSurface` builder unifies `config show` and `doctor` workspace state.

### Changed
- `meridian kg check` now reports broken links, `[!FLAG]` blocks, and git conflict markers. Broken links and flags are warnings (exit 0); conflict markers are errors (exit 1). `--strict` makes warnings exit-affecting. JSON includes all categories/counts. No early exit.
- `git-autosync` rebase conflicts stay in clone for review by default; `conflict_policy = "abort"` restores old abort behavior. Future runs detect existing rebase state, skip all operations.
- Bundled `mars-agents` 0.1.2 → 0.1.3.
- Workspace file location follows `MERIDIAN_PROJECT_ROOT` — lives at `state_root.parent / workspace.local.toml`.

## [0.0.30] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- New `finalizing` spawn state between `running` and terminal. Covers the harness-exited-but-drain-in-flight window so the reaper stops stamping live spawns mid-drain. Shows up in `spawn show`, stats, and `--status` filter.
- `spawn show` renders `orphan_finalization` distinct from `orphan_run` — tells apart drain-window hangs from runner-dead-during-run.

### Changed
- `meridian kg check` now reports broken links, `[!FLAG]` blocks, and git conflict markers. Broken links and flags are warnings (exit 0); conflict markers are errors (exit 1). `--strict` makes warnings exit-affecting. JSON includes all categories/counts. No early exit.
- `git-autosync` rebase conflicts stay in clone for review by default; `conflict_policy = "abort"` restores old abort behavior. Future runs detect existing rebase state, skip all operations.
- `meridian-dev-workflow` bumped 0.0.25 → 0.0.26 via `meridian mars sync`.
- `@impl-orchestrator` now runs a mandatory Explore phase before planning — verifies design against code reality, produces `plan/pre-planning-notes.md` as a gate artifact, terminates to a Redesign Brief when design is falsified.
- `agent-staffing` skill: new "Fan-Out vs Parallel Lanes" terminology section (same-prompt-different-models vs different-prompts-different-focus-areas); new `@reviewer as Architectural Drift Gate` section (CI-spawned reviewer enforces structural invariants semantically against a declared-invariant prompt).
- `AGENTS.md` model-routing block removed — model choice delegated to profile defaults and `meridian models list`.
- Reaper no longer false-positives over live spawns. Heartbeat window 120s, 15s startup grace, PID-reuse margin 30s, depth-gated so nested sweeps can't stamp their parents. Authority rule: runner/launcher/cancel writes always win over reconciler writes, so a late report corrects a premature stamp. Fixes recurrence of #14.
- Runner owns the heartbeat task now (30s tick, cancelled in outer `finally`), not the reaper.
- `finalize_spawn(..., origin=...)` is mandatory at every call site.
- `update_spawn` no longer accepts `status=` — lifecycle transitions go through `mark_finalizing` / `finalize_spawn` only.
- `meridian-base` package ref bumped to pick up refined prompt-writing guidance in `agent-creator` and `skill-creator`.
- Bundled `mars-agents` bumped from `0.0.14` to `0.1.1`.

### Fixed
- Codex adapter silently truncated initial prompts over 50 KiB, emitted a `warning/promptTruncated` event, and continued with the mutilated input — turning over-limit planner briefs into "no task provided" runs. Claude and OpenCode had no analogous ceiling at all. All three adapters now share one 10 MiB ceiling via `validate_prompt_size()` in `lib/harness/connections/base.py`; over-limit prompts raise `PromptTooLargeError` naming actual vs allowed bytes and the harness, before any transport contact.
- `meridian spawn --help` text now matches behavior. Was "Runs in background by default. Use --foreground to block." — both halves wrong (default is foreground, `--foreground` flag does not exist). Now describes `--background` as the opt-in flag it actually is.

### Removed
- "awaiting finalization" heuristic in detail view. Replaced by real `finalizing` status.
- Checked-in git submodules `meridian-base/` and `meridian-dev-workflow/`. Mars package deps now source of truth.

### Reverted
- R06 launch-refactor skeleton (8 commits, `3f8ad4c..45d18d7`) that landed post-v0.0.29 but never shipped in a tagged release. Skeleton was built while the codex prompt-truncation bug above was corrupting coder briefs; smoke evidence after Fix A revealed structural regressions (fork lineage split-brain in new `launch/fork.py`, row-before-fork ordering, OpenCode report extraction returning raw `session.idle` envelopes). Design package preserved under `.meridian/work/workspace-config-design/` as input for a clean retry on top of the restored tagged-stable baseline. No user impact since v0.0.29 is before the skeleton.

## [0.0.28] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- Primary `meridian` launch startup agent catalog. Fresh and forked sessions now show installed agents before user input. Claude gets it in appended system prompt; Codex and OpenCode inline.

### Changed
- `meridian kg check` now reports broken links, `[!FLAG]` blocks, and git conflict markers. Broken links and flags are warnings (exit 0); conflict markers are errors (exit 1). `--strict` makes warnings exit-affecting. JSON includes all categories/counts. No early exit.
- `git-autosync` rebase conflicts stay in clone for review by default; `conflict_policy = "abort"` restores old abort behavior. Future runs detect existing rebase state, skip all operations.
- Startup inventory now agent-only. Skills still load through normal harness launch path, but not duplicated in startup catalog.

### Fixed
- `session log` and `session search` now tell `chat not found` apart from `chat has no transcript yet`.
- Chat ref resolution now falls back to primary spawn harness session id when the chat row has none.
- `pytest-llm` launcher now uses current interpreter path more reliably.

## [0.0.27] - 2026-04-12

### Changed
- `meridian kg check` now reports broken links, `[!FLAG]` blocks, and git conflict markers. Broken links and flags are warnings (exit 0); conflict markers are errors (exit 1). `--strict` makes warnings exit-affecting. JSON includes all categories/counts. No early exit.
- `git-autosync` rebase conflicts stay in clone for review by default; `conflict_policy = "abort"` restores old abort behavior. Future runs detect existing rebase state, skip all operations.
- Dev workflow package updated for unified `impl-orchestrator`.

### Fixed
- Spawn model validation now resolves models from the Meridian repo root instead of drifting with CWD.
- Codex streamed report extraction now accepts current event names instead of dropping final agent output.

## [0.0.26] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **Streaming runner**: bidirectional streaming spawn pipeline. All three harnesses (Claude, Codex, OpenCode) route through unified `execute_with_streaming` path with connection-level event consumption, budget tracking, and retry.
- **`ResolvedLaunchSpec` hierarchy**: transport-neutral launch spec per harness. `ClaudeLaunchSpec`, `CodexLaunchSpec`, `OpenCodeLaunchSpec` — each adapter owns `resolve_launch_spec()` and `build_command()`. Replaces strategy maps.
- **`--debug` mode**: structured JSONL tracing across all pipeline layers. `meridian spawn --debug` emits trace events for harness launch, event consumption, extraction, and finalization.
- **`psutil`-based process liveness**: cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows). PID-reuse detection via `create_time()`. Replaces `/proc/stat` parsing and `os.kill(pid, 0)`.
- **`SpawnExitedEvent`**: new event type separating process exit from finalization. Spawn stays `running` after process exits until report extraction completes — prevents false orphan detection.
- **`runner_pid` tracking**: each spawn records which PID is responsible for finalization. Foreground spawns set it in `start` event; background spawns set it in `update` after wrapper launches.
- **`MERIDIAN_ACTIVE_WORK_DIR` and `MERIDIAN_ACTIVE_WORK_ID` exported** into harness sessions.
- `CHANGELOG.md` resumed after staleness. Now in caveman style.

### Changed
- `meridian kg check` now reports broken links, `[!FLAG]` blocks, and git conflict markers. Broken links and flags are warnings (exit 0); conflict markers are errors (exit 1). `--strict` makes warnings exit-affecting. JSON includes all categories/counts. No early exit.
- `git-autosync` rebase conflicts stay in clone for review by default; `conflict_policy = "abort"` restores old abort behavior. Future runs detect existing rebase state, skip all operations.
- **Reaper rewrite**: 500-line state machine → 119 lines (~30 core). No PID files, no heartbeat, no foreground/background dispatch. Just: is `runner_pid` alive? Branch on `exited_at` presence.
- **PID/heartbeat file elimination**: `harness.pid`, `background.pid`, `heartbeat` removed. PIDs come from event stream only. Spawn directories are artifact-only.
- **`SpawnExtractor` protocol**: extraction split from adapter into composable protocol. `StreamingExtractor` wraps harness bundle for connection-aware extraction.
- **Streaming parity**: all three harnesses converge on shared launch context, env invariants, permission pipeline, and projection paths. 8-phase implementation.
- **Bundle registry**: immutable after registration. Import-time side effects populate global registry.
- Claude readline limit raised to 128 MiB for large conversation echoes.
- `.agents/` and `.claude/` removed from tracking — generated output only.

### Fixed
- Spawn orphan false-failures: `exited` event + psutil liveness prevents reaper from racing runner's post-exit finalization.
- Streaming runner completion/signal races: F2 residual race when completion and signal land on same wakeup.
- Harness binary not found now produces diagnostic error instead of silent failure.
- Codex: server-initiated JSON-RPC requests handled; send lock prevents interleaved writes.
- OpenCode: chunked response handling on message POST.
- SIGTERM masked during `streaming_serve` finalization — prevents double-cleanup.
- Continue/fork wired for Claude and Codex streaming adapters.
- Child env `WORK_DIR` fallback and `autocompact` inheritance (#12).
- Effort field wired through `PreparedSpawnPlan` to both runners.

## [0.0.5] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- `gpt52` builtin alias for `gpt-5.2`; Claude `tools` passthrough in launch plan

### Changed
- `meridian kg check` now reports broken links, `[!FLAG]` blocks, and git conflict markers. Broken links and flags are warnings (exit 0); conflict markers are errors (exit 1). `--strict` makes warnings exit-affecting. JSON includes all categories/counts. No early exit.
- `git-autosync` rebase conflicts stay in clone for review by default; `conflict_policy = "abort"` restores old abort behavior. Future runs detect existing rebase state, skip all operations.
- Auto-resolve builtin aliases from discovered models; manifest-first bootstrap

## [0.0.4] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- Model catalog split with routing, visibility, descriptions, and `models.toml` config

## [0.0.3] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- Bootstrap state tracking with builtin skills and source recording; designer agent

## [0.0.2] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- `.meridian/.gitignore` seeding and stale CLI commands in docs

## [0.0.1] - 2026-02-25

Initial release — core CLI (`spawn`, `session`, `work`), harness adapters (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode), agent profiles, skill system, sync engine, JSONL state stores.

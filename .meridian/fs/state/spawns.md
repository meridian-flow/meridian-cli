# Spawn Store

Source: `src/meridian/lib/state/spawn_store.py`, `src/meridian/lib/state/reaper.py`, `src/meridian/lib/state/liveness.py`

## Event Model

Spawns are tracked as an append-only event sequence in `.meridian/spawns.jsonl`. Four event types:

**`start`** — written when spawn is created. Fields include:
- `id` (e.g. `p1`, `p2`), `chat_id`, `parent_id`
- `model`, `agent`, `agent_path`, `skills`, `skill_paths`, `harness`
- `kind` (`"child"` or `"primary"`), `desc`, `work_id`
- `harness_session_id`, `execution_cwd`, `launch_mode`
- `worker_pid`, `runner_pid`, `status` (initial: `"running"` or `"queued"`), `prompt`, `started_at`

`runner_pid` on the start event identifies the foreground/primary runner — the process responsible for post-exit finalization. For foreground spawns this is `os.getpid()` at launch time.

**`update`** — non-terminal state change. Fields: `id`, `status`, `launch_mode`, `wrapper_pid`, `worker_pid`, `runner_pid`, `harness_session_id`, `execution_cwd`, `error`, `desc`, `work_id`.

`runner_pid` on the update event is used for background spawns: the wrapper process PID is recorded here once the background launch stabilizes.

**`exited`** — written immediately when the harness process exits (before report extraction or any post-exit work). Fields: `id`, `exit_code`, `exited_at` (ISO 8601 UTC).

This event is **informational, not terminal**. The spawn status stays `running` after an `exited` event — the runner is still draining pipes, extracting reports, and persisting artifacts. The event is a lifecycle marker the reaper uses to distinguish "runner is finalizing" from "runner hasn't done anything yet." (Decision D9: making `exited` terminal would create a window where spawns appear "done" but lack report data.)

**`finalize`** — terminal event. Fields: `id`, `status`, `exit_code`, `finished_at`, `duration_secs`, `total_cost_usd`, `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `error`.

`SpawnRecord` is the projection: derived by replaying all events for a spawn ID.

## ID Generation

`next_spawn_id()` counts `start` events in `spawns.jsonl` and returns `p{count+1}`. IDs are sequential and monotonic. Allocation happens under the spawns flock so concurrent spawners don't collide.

## SpawnRecord

`SpawnRecord` is the projection: assembled from all events for a spawn. Key fields:

- `runner_pid` — PID of the process responsible for finalization (sourced from start or update event)
- `exited_at` — timestamp from the `exited` event (None if harness hasn't exited yet)
- `process_exit_code` — raw exit code from the `exited` event (distinct from the `exit_code` in the finalize event, which is the final outcome code)
- All other fields follow from start/update/finalize events

## Terminal Status Merging

`finalize_spawn()` uses **first-terminal-event-wins** semantics. The first `finalize` event that finds the spawn in an active state sets the terminal `status`, `exit_code`, and `error`; subsequent finalize events cannot change those fields. Metadata (duration, cost, tokens) is still merged from every finalize event so audit details are preserved.

Rationale: simpler and correct for the common case. If the reaper races with the primary runner and both finalize concurrently, whoever commits first owns the status. Metadata accumulation ensures neither writer loses its cost/token contribution.

`finalize_spawn()` always appends the event even if the spawn is already terminal — this ensures cost/token metadata isn't lost. Returns `True` if this call moved the spawn from active (`queued` or `running`) → terminal, `False` if the spawn was already terminal or does not exist.

## Spawn Statuses

Active: `queued`, `running`
Terminal: `succeeded`, `failed`, `cancelled`

There is no `timeout` status. Timeouts result in `failed` status with a timeout-related failure reason.

Presence of an `exited` event does **not** change the spawn's projected status. The spawn stays `running` until a `finalize` event arrives. This means `spawn wait` blocks until finalize, not exited.

## Reaper (`reaper.py`)

The reaper runs on every read path (`spawn list`, `spawn show`, `spawn wait`, dashboard). It auto-repairs active spawns that have become orphaned. No separate GC command.

**Core logic** (`reconcile_active_spawn`):

1. If `runner_pid` is absent or ≤ 0:
   - Within startup grace window (15s from `started_at`): leave alone
   - Otherwise: finalize as `failed` with error `missing_worker_pid`

2. Check `runner_pid` liveness via `is_process_alive()`:
   - **Alive**: leave alone (still working)
   - **Dead**: proceed to step 3

3. Select orphan reason based on `exited_at` presence:
   - `exited_at` is None → `orphan_run` (runner died before harness even exited)
   - `exited_at` is set → `orphan_finalization` (harness exited, runner died during post-exit work)

4. If dead runner + no `exited_at` + within startup grace: leave alone (covers the brief gap between `start_spawn()` and the runner establishing its PID)

5. Check for durable report (`report.md` with content):
   - Present: finalize as `succeeded` (work completed before crash)
   - Absent: finalize as `failed` with the orphan reason from step 3

**Error codes:**
- `orphan_run` — runner died before the harness exited. Neither harness nor runner survived. Suggests a hard kill or OOM.
- `orphan_finalization` — harness exited cleanly, but runner died during post-exit processing (report extraction, artifact persistence). Rarer; suggests infrastructure issues, not harness problems. (Decision D15)
- `missing_worker_pid` — no `runner_pid` recorded and outside startup grace. Spawn started but PID was never committed to the event stream.

**Startup grace window:** 15 seconds after `started_at`. Applied to spawns with no `exited` event where the runner PID hasn't been recorded yet. This is the only timing heuristic — no staleness thresholds, no heartbeat checks.

## Liveness (`liveness.py`)

`is_process_alive(pid, created_after_epoch)` — psutil-based, cross-platform process liveness check.

- Uses `psutil.pid_exists()` for fast path.
- Retrieves `psutil.Process(pid).create_time()` to guard against PID reuse: if the process was created more than 2 seconds after `created_after_epoch` (the spawn's `started_at` epoch), it's a different process that reused the PID.
- Calls `proc.is_running()` as the final liveness confirmation after the PID-reuse guard passes.
- Returns `True` on `psutil.AccessDenied` (process exists, can't inspect — conservatively assume alive).
- Returns `False` on `psutil.NoSuchProcess` (process vanished between `pid_exists` and `Process(pid)` — treat as dead).

Replaces the prior Linux-only `/proc/stat` boot time + clock tick approach. Decision D10: psutil chosen for cross-platform support and built-in `create_time()` PID-reuse detection with no transitive dependencies.

## Artifact Directory

Each spawn gets `.meridian/spawns/<id>/` containing only durable artifacts (Decision D13: no PID files, heartbeat files, or coordination signals in spawn dirs — the event stream is self-sufficient):

- `prompt.md` — the prompt text
- `report.md` — the agent's run report (explicit or auto-extracted)
- `output.jsonl` — raw harness stdout (JSON stream events)
- `stderr.log` — harness stderr, warnings, and errors
- `params.json` — spawn parameters
- `tokens.json` — token usage record
- `bg-worker-params.json` — background launch parameters (background spawns only)

`spawn files` returns the list of files a spawn created/modified, for use with `xargs git add`.
